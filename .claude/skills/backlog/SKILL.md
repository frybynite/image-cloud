# Backlog

Read `docs/backlog.md` and display a summary organized into three sections:

1. **Active Issues** - List all unchecked (`- [ ]`) items from the "Active Issues" section
2. **Planned** - List each planned item with its title and a one-line summary
3. **Ideas** - List each idea as a concise bullet point

Do NOT include completed items (checked `- [x]`). Present the output in a clean, readable format.
